   <p style="font-size: 30px;font-family: Gill Sans;">
       This way of styling i.e adding  style attribute to the elements that we want to do styling 
       is called <b style="color: crimson;">inline css</b>.Here property was color and value is blue
       In css ";" marks the end of that particular property.suppose we had a a lot of elements,then 
       adding style attribute to each of the element is not feasible and it is time consuming,there is
       no code re-usability.
